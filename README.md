# laravel-blade

> DEPRECATED

Syntax highlighting for Laravel's Blade. Converted from
[language-blade](https://github.com/jawee/language-blade).

I don't maintain this, as I don't write PHP anymore. I highly suggest trying out [this misleadingly named extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=onecentlin.laravel-blade), which I probably would have used if I had known it does syntax highlighting.
